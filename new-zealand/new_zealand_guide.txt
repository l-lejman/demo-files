New Zealand, located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, is a country known for its stunning natural beauty, rich Maori culture, and outdoor adventure opportunities. It comprises two main landmasses—the North Island and the South Island—as well as over 700 smaller islands. With a population of approximately 5.2 million people (as of 2025), New Zealand offers a unique blend of modern lifestyle and preserved wilderness.

Capital
Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand. Located at the southern tip of the North Island, Wellington is known for its vibrant arts scene, political significance, and beautiful harbor views. Despite not being the largest city (that title goes to Auckland), Wellington is a cultural and governmental hub.

Tourist Tips

- Currency: The local currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZD). Credit cards are widely accepted.

- Language: English is the dominant language, but Maori is also an official language. Learning a few Maori greetings (like "Kia ora") is appreciated.

- Biosecurity: New Zealand has strict biosecurity laws. Declare any food, outdoor gear, or animal products upon arrival to avoid hefty fines.

- Nature Etiquette: Stay on marked trails, don’t feed wildlife, and follow the Leave No Trace principles to preserve the environment.

- Adventure Safety: Many tourist activities involve outdoor risks. Always follow safety briefings and weather advisories, especially when hiking or engaging in water sports.
